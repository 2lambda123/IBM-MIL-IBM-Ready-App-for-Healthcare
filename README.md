# IBM-Ready-App-for-Healthcare

### Overview

IBM Ready App for Healthcare is the first of the IBM Ready App Series. This app seeks to improve patient recovery timeframes and patient adherence to at-home physical therapy programs by tracking patient progress regardless of the wearable they use, giving them access to a customized at-home exercise library that can be accessed anywhere with their mobile device, and allowing them to track and manage their pain levels through their recovery process. With this app, patients can also fill out medical questionnaires and progress reports from any place with their mobile device prior to their in-clinic appointments.
